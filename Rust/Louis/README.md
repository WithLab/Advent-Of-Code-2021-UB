## Louis
This folder contains all my solves for the [advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) event.

## Usage
If you would like to run all my solutions at once just use `cargo run`.

To run a specific day use `cargo run [day]`\
For example, `cargo run 2` will run all parts of day two.

To only run a specific part of a specific day use `cargo run [day] [part]`.\
For example, `argo run 2 1` will run only part two of day two.
